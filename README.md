# x86-space-invaders
A bootable 32-bit/64-bit x86 Space Invaders emulator written in C/Assembler. The code is useful for anyone wanting to learn about the Intel 8080, x86 32-bit protected mode or 64-bit long mode. It runs in QEMU and on real hardware, the Makefile contains rules for building a disk image with GRUB as the boot loader. 

The code executes as a simple loop emulating instructions of the Intel 8080 with interrupts handling keyboard input and graphics update. printf goes to COM1 (port 0x3f8), when running QEMU the "-serial stdio" option sends the printf output to the terminal QEMU was launched from. The 8080 ROM image to execute is loaded as a multiboot1 module, the roms directory contains two images:

* roms/invaders.rom
* roms/cpudiag.rom - an Intel 8080 test suite

The disk images created by the Makefile contain GRUB entries to select which ROM to run.

## To build:
    make all

## To run:
    # run (32-bit) with qemu-system-i386
    make run-i386
    # run (64-bit) with qemu-system-x86_64
    make run-x86_64

# Requirements
No external libraries are required, very basic support is provided in stdio.c/memset.c. Building requires **i686-elf-gcc** for 32-bit and **x86_64-elf-gcc** for 64-bit. If those compilers are not available in your environment then take a look at https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_bones
